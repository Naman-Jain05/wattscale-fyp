# Building Energy Efficiency Analysis Using Advanced Statistical Methods

This project aims to enhance building energy efficiency through advanced statistical analysis and thermodynamic principles. It employs a systematic approach to model and optimize energy consumption in residential buildings, ensuring accuracy and reliability in energy efficiency assessments.

Methodologies Employed:

Data Preprocessing: Rigorous cleaning and normalization of energy consumption data to ensure consistency and reliability in subsequent analyses.

Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC): Utilization of MCMC methods to estimate parameter distributions, crucial for capturing uncertainties and variability in energy usage patterns.

K-Means Clustering: Grouping of buildings based on similar energy consumption profiles, facilitating comparative analysis and identification of inefficiencies within clusters.

Thermodynamic Principles: Application of fundamental thermodynamic principles, particularly focusing on balance point temperatures (Theat for heating, Tcool for cooling), to model energy dynamics influenced by external weather conditions.

Piece-wise Linear Model: Implementation of a degree-day model to represent energy consumption as a function of external temperature, offering a flexible and accurate depiction of heating and cooling demands.

Bayesian Inference: Integration of Bayesian methods to handle parameter uncertainties, providing realistic estimates and insights into energy efficiency improvements.

Key Objectives:

Decision Support: Identification of inefficient buildings using second-order stochastic dominance within clusters, guiding recommendations for insulation, airtightness improvements, and HVAC system upgrades.

Impact: Empowering stakeholders with actionable insights for optimizing energy consumption and reducing environmental impact in residential buildings.

Future Directions:

Expansion to incorporate additional factors influencing energy consumption, such as occupancy patterns and building orientation.
Integration of real-time data for dynamic energy management and predictive analytics.
Application of the methodology to diverse building types and geographical regions to enhance scalability and applicability.

Conclusion:

This project represents a comprehensive effort to leverage advanced statistical methods and thermodynamic principles for the purpose of improving building energy efficiency. By combining theoretical frameworks with practical applications, it aims to support sustainable energy practices and inform strategic decision-making in the construction and energy sectors.
